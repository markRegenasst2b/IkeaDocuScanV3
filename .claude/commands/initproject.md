description: Initialize project context by reading key documentation files
---

Read the following files to understand the IkeaDocuScan project context:
- IkeaDocuScanV3/Documentation/ImplementationDetails/ARCHITECTURE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

After reading, provide a brief confirmation that you're ready to work on the project.

When creating powershell scripts do not use graphical characters and do not use `n.

The test user profile names are reader, publisher, adadmin, and superuser.

Do not build the application, I will do it manually and paste you the errors if any.
Do not use git, I will commit.
