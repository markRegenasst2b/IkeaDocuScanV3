    remove issuperuser from gui, keep it hidden.


Question
    Is document registering and check-in constraint by users permissions? can a user register a document type she/he is not permitted to?
    
Propositions
    in search restrict the document types to the permissions of the user (show all if the user has no permissions or a permission with null document type)
    
    
Issues
    When adding a new document type and then looking this new document type up in manage document names, adding document names is not possible.
