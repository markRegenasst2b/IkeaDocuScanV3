Propositions
    in search restrict the document types to the permissions of the user (show all if the user has no permissions or a permission with null document type)
    are ther default actions per document type? can we support this in the document registry.
    
    
Issues
    When adding a new document type and then looking this new document type up in manage document names, adding document names is not possible.
